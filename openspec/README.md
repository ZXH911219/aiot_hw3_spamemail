# OpenSpec directory

This folder contains OpenSpec artifacts for the repository.

- `project.md` — Project context and conventions (source of truth for proposals and reviewers).
- `proposals/` — Change proposals. Current proposals:
  - `0002-spam-classification.md` (draft, spam classification + automation merged)
- `specs/` — Capability specs (empty for now)
- `changes/` — Active changes and archived changes

How to use:
- Read `project.md` before drafting or reviewing proposals.
- Create proposals under `openspec/proposals/` using the numeric prefix and short slug.
- Run any proposal validators or CI as configured.
